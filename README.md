# Verification-of-an-8-bit-ALU-module
Performed verification of an 8-bit arithmetic logic module using constraint random testing and UVM libraries.   

Salient features: 

1. Verification environment was build using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). 

2. Designed different UVM classes such as sequence, sequencer, driver, monitor and scoreboard to perform the verification.  

3. Different sequences were generated to detect the faulty ALU DUT (Design Under Test). 

4. The design is highly reusable.
